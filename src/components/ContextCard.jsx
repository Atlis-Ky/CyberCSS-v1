        <h3 className="mt-3">How To Use</h3>
        <p>
          Easy! Just head to the rep and either download the cyber.css file into
          your project, or just paste the file into your own code, super
          straightforward stuff. The stylesheet is designed to target both
          generic and some unique classes, I'd reccomend having a quick scroll
          through the sections, and using the shortcut <code>âŒ˜ + F</code> on MacOS,
          or <code>CTRL + F</code> on windows to find any specific classes you're looking to
          target.
